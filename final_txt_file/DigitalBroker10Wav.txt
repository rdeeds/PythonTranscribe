spk_0: Welcome

spk_7: back to the digital

spk_0: broker i'm steve anderson here with my co host ryan deeds ryan how are you today

spk_2: I'm awesome steve good morning right

spk_0: to you we have an interesting topic we're goingto start off with today

spk_1: texting something

spk_0: that every agency's doing whether they realize it or not and something that is requiring a lot more thought and management around that

spk_1: type

spk_0: of communication that's going on between agency staff both internal and outside

spk_1: and

spk_0: prospects and clients because the documentation of those is a key issue and a key

spk_1: um it's

spk_2: an exposure right yeah

spk_0: i was going i was like of searching for the right word i want to use that it is a real exposure in fact i think it's probably one of the biggest you know holes that is in an agency's documentation right now

spk_1: and

spk_0: with that said i always tell people okay take a deep breath

spk_1: we've always

spk_0: had these issues i remember when email first started being used as a primary communication method we had problems with how do we capture that email and documented before our systems caught up with us So

spk_4: yes it's

spk_0: new and know we've been here before we sort of know how to do it but what we want to talk about in this particular episode are it's um you know very specific

spk_1: thoughts

spk_0: steps and ideas behind text messaging and how your agency should be

spk_1: if they

spk_0: haven't already putting in policies and procedures around that communication channel

spk_1: so

spk_7: i think the first question is

spk_0: you know who's texting

spk_1: right

spk_2: I mean and i think that's you

spk_7: know you

spk_2: asked me that a couple days back and i was like you know they'll be texan our office because you know we have we

spk_5: do have a policy

spk_2: and we've talked about that and you're like

spk_1: nobody

spk_2: takes your producers

spk_1: and

spk_2: then i started thinking about i'm like yeah

spk_5: yeah they do of course

spk_2: that's that's you know that's the met you know when you look at why sms has come up so quickly it's except for where we are with it today it's accessible every phone khun do it you don't have to have an app to do it you know It just makes it very quick

spk_1: and

spk_2: that's the method of communication that all of our younger people are wanting the leverage and so we're just seeing that more and more and so sure yeah i guaranteed that there's all kinds of communication going back and forth between those producers in that client setting expectation for the client which at that point then probably opens us up to some challenges

spk_7: yeah no question

spk_0: and and and certainly age i think is a factor but it's not just the younger people who seem to be texting more i think more and more people just in general

spk_6: it drives you cause you're texting your kids you're here texting your kids you become my mom you said i'm never texting and that man she texts me all the time because

spk_2: it's kind of a mandated look look i don't want to talk

spk_6: about i don't know yeah if you want to talk to me tax and i think you

spk_0: know certainly parents are experiencing

spk_7: some of that and

spk_0: so it's just becoming a bit more natural the more people are using it

spk_7: which is okay

spk_0: i think we need to be open and available to our clients and prospects to communicate with them the way they want to be communicated with and at the same time we've got some very specific responsibilities in terms of really clients and prospects to document what's going on and i think that's the biggest issue that

spk_1: i think

spk_0: agency's owners are aware of but let's talk through you know just kind of some steps sorts of things that agency personnel staff need to be thinking about when they're using text messaging

spk_1: I

spk_2: mean i think that when you talk start talking legal right And if you're in an agency that has

spk_5: ah some kind of

spk_2: legal mind that's your compliance person it probably scares the heck out of them because

spk_5: their first thing is

spk_2: how do we get to the documentation

spk_5: to ensure that we

spk_2: didn't decline that flood

spk_5: or that we didn't do

spk_2: extra y

spk_5: you know that we able where

spk_2: we'll process this bob and so i think you know you have to approach it from from that standpoint

spk_5: first is

spk_2: if you do have to me there's two or three

spk_5: main areas of worry

spk_2: one is obviously your employees safety right rendering out in police cell phone numbers is a challenge and if that becomes the main mechanism that client

spk_4: uses

spk_2: to communicate

spk_1: then

spk_2: who holds that

spk_5: relationship is that the account

spk_2: manager is that

spk_4: where does i go

spk_2: if something occurs and how do we keep record of that but really putting them putting that employees out there is one of my first problems second

spk_4: problem is obviously

spk_2: how do i get record of that and howto i ensure that my compliance officer has the ability to toe look through i mean

spk_5: we use our email orc

spk_2: ivor every freaking week you know hey we need to go find this letter hey we need to go find that or document management

spk_1: and

spk_2: so i'm sure that some people

spk_4: are taking screenshots

spk_2: of their tax and putting it in there but without a central control authority where you have a policy

spk_5: in your organisation

spk_2: at that point you really are opening yourself up you know if you have the policy even if people are non compliant to it at least if somebody breaks the rule you can call back and say here's my policy

spk_3: here is the privacy in here here's

spk_0: what we need to do so

spk_7: i guess you know in my

spk_0: mind the first episode find out who's texting

spk_1: and who

spk_0: they are texting that's

spk_7: right Right that's right So and frankly

spk_0: your comment i'm not sure i had thought of it as until you brought that up which is internal employee communication right So

spk_1: staff to producer and

spk_0: my question then starts okay do we need to document that also or just the

spk_1: producer

spk_0: client text communication will that if we start documenting all text communication regan and i would say most of

spk_6: them your compliance officer was going to say i want to see the nuance of the discussion that led you to this policy

spk_2: decision for coverage

spk_3: and so no question yeah to me or or here's an

spk_0: answer to a question that

spk_3: the producer gives to the client

spk_0: so we need the documentation where that answer came from and

spk_2: you run into this a lot because like if

spk_4: you use any other communication

spk_2: mechanism other than email you have to figure out this because if you're using a collaboration tooling microsoft teams

spk_5: or

spk_2: a hip chat or slack or whatever there's

spk_6: a lot of conversation that

spk_2: goes him there you know how

spk_4: are you ensuring that

spk_2: that you're capturing

spk_4: that as well

spk_2: Texting is a little more complex because if you have one hundred

spk_4: people in your

spk_3: office you have one hundred cell phone's

spk_2: in your office and if you have twenty clients that air texting

spk_3: one employee

spk_2: how the heck are you keeping track of that You know

spk_7: well and i would even say

spk_0: hundreds you know cell phones highly likely they're not all the same

spk_3: that's right So now

spk_0: each phone has a different process and procedure for screen shot and we'll talk a bit more about some of that technical side of how to actually capture some of that information

spk_4: and what can be shared via

spk_2: text i mean the thing when you look at email systems and where we've had to go for

spk_4: security with email

spk_2: right on encrypted email heck

spk_4: if you send the ding

spk_2: on text with you

spk_5: know hip information

spk_2: or social security

spk_5: information are you opening up huge holes there You know

spk_7: yeah that's an interesting thought because

spk_0: on one hand email really does go out into the wide internet

spk_3: area where his

spk_0: text messages ah bit more device to device however that that text is being stored on somebody serve or somewhere

spk_3: oh yeah i mean if you so you know

spk_0: again who

spk_7: knows where we

spk_0: haven't really looked at that in terms of ok where is all this information

spk_3: go How many touchpoints

spk_2: did it go through

spk_5: I mean you know if you look it

spk_2: like some of these ap eyes that are out there when you're scanning the texts everything

spk_6: is sitting on their

spk_2: server in plain text and you can see it and so whatever was shared with your client has gone through a couple of cops you know and so that's always something that kind of makes me leary how much

spk_5: can you share

spk_2: because we do use encrypted email you know

spk_3: correct you have to

spk_2: today and so

spk_1: it's

spk_2: just it is it opens up

spk_5: a whole can of worms that really the what we hope

spk_2: today is the agency's just get thinking about that you know because it's so convenient your customer does want it

spk_0: oh there's no question we have to do it and i always want to be careful that we don't get too mired in the

spk_1: oh

spk_0: i'm gonna probably get in trouble for saying this into the compliance so that we come back and say to our clients no we can't do this

spk_1: right and and

spk_0: there's got to be a balance there between the risk the agency broker takes on in terms of using this channel and the fact that clients really one

spk_4: other agencies not going to be a

spk_2: cz conscientious is

spk_5: each one right

spk_2: and so if i have an agency again we talk

spk_4: about the future of

spk_5: insurance in future of insurance

spk_2: agencies frictionless communication is one of things we talked about a lot texting is the is a tactical

spk_5: representation of frictionless

spk_2: communication right

spk_3: right it makes

spk_2: it easy i

spk_6: as a consumer have a

spk_2: record of that conversation

spk_3: all right on my phone so i know where

spk_2: that goes And so uh i'm in the same boat

spk_3: I see a lot of

spk_2: technology get passed off because of the ramifications right in the

spk_1: compliance

spk_2: issues How do we speed up that balancing act How do we bring nontechnical individuals into

spk_5: the fold Have

spk_2: that conversation to be ableto help mitigate some of this stuff on and that's a difficult thing

spk_3: It just got so much stuff

spk_2: going on in agency Yeah

spk_0: it iss and as you said

spk_7: i hope this

spk_0: conversation will help spur conversations

spk_3: with

spk_0: management teams in you know the agents rivers that are listening so find out who's texting find out the device being used

spk_1: We

spk_0: talked a bit about elektronik communication policy that's kind of my term But what is the agency policy for this type of communication

spk_1: I personally

spk_0: don't believe it's a separate policy i think it's part of as i just said the elektronik communication policy which includes all kinds of things in social platforms email texting and who knows what other slack

spk_7: right

spk_0: all of the various platforms that we might be using for communication we need to have a policy that addresses all of those and a broad enough manner and specific enough to give guidance to staff that's

spk_2: where i just think that you know for sms because it is so ubiquitous everybody uses it it's one of the things that agency kind of needs to bring special attention to um

spk_1: because

spk_2: it's so easy

spk_4: for you to

spk_2: get caught in that i mean i do have account managers that are like dang it this client texted me today you know what do i do with this now

spk_7: you know

spk_3: on another account managers will say

spk_2: hey we've got clients that wanna text i don't want to give him my cell

spk_3: phone number right

spk_2: You know

spk_7: if your personal

spk_2: account manager the last thing you want is for four hundred

spk_6: clients have you're

spk_2: doing on cellphone number

spk_0: yeah no yeah and i think again you've mentioned that early in terms of employees protection

spk_7: you know i think that is

spk_0: a absolutely an issue teo to consider and be aware of so

spk_1: communication

spk_0: policy for me next step is really looking or management system ah and upgrading to whatever current capability they have in terms of managing text and we're going to talk a bit more detail about what that looks like in actually the next episode because we won't have enough time to cover all of that here but there are a number of agency management system vendors who have upgraded or are upgrading their system to add texting inbound and outbound to their platform the benefit there will be the documentation of that will be automatic

spk_7: meaning

spk_0: it will be added to their client file just like you use email now

spk_1: and

spk_0: being able to text from a keyboard right using that same process

spk_1: One

spk_0: thing i didn't want to mention when you mentioned as a mass there are actually two different kinds of texts

spk_1: Sms

spk_0: short message service

spk_7: and mdms

spk_0: multimedia service

spk_1: I know them well Um you

spk_0: know him better than i do actually And so we talk about sms a lot That's just the text only base one hundred sixty Character limit per message If you do more than that it spills over into a second message

spk_7: versus an mm

spk_0: s where we can add

spk_1: files in essence files

spk_3: photos photos You can send links via sms

spk_2: And so you know that that's to me

spk_3: that opens up a

spk_2: challenge right Because i could upload a policy to dropbox don't do it but i could

spk_7: do that And

spk_2: then i could sms that off to a client and say i mean we

spk_4: thought about that we used to secure

spk_2: file sharing system called ignite that would be able to integrate relatively easy with that But now you are transmitting something that is

spk_4: very specific

spk_2: over this mechanism

spk_1: but that

spk_2: does keep you in the sms world

spk_1: in

spk_2: the mass you could take pictures

spk_1: right right and

spk_2: that's that that's the primary thing it's funny though most eight hundred numbers you can't leverage that with you know you have to have like a local number for most the time right

spk_2:

spk_7: Well in a potential

spk_0: advantage of in my really reason for bringing up in a mess is to your character limit is sixteen hundred

spk_1: so

spk_0: a whole lot more information and in typing right tax

spk_1: and

spk_0: picture so now you could have a picture of the producer or

spk_7: they should claim or picture of the claim

spk_3: before right

spk_0: So there's some interesting capability there in that service so just i just wanted people to be aware of those two different types and there are some advantages i i use emma mass

spk_1: texting

spk_0: when people asked for my business card because i don't carry paper business credit anymore

spk_7: Oh and i have a process

spk_0: where they can receive that

spk_1: via text

spk_0: file that's my v card

spk_7: right elektronik

spk_0: contact information on their phone they can just open that add it to their contact record

spk_1: i can include a photo

spk_0: in there so next time they receive something from me

spk_1: there it actually

spk_0: shows up as a picture get a better engagement opportunity s o there

spk_1: lots of interesting

spk_0: little nuances there for using you

spk_4: there's a lot of opportunities

spk_2: to humanize that right Yes tio extend that client experience that we're all kind of looking for

spk_0: yep exactly

spk_1: so upgrade

spk_0: we'll talk more about kind of management system specific functionality in a little bit but trained staff

spk_1: and

spk_0: have a very specific

spk_1: process

spk_0: in place communication policies certainly the foundation of that but now trained staff on

spk_1: when

spk_0: is texting appropriate in what circumstances maybe is it not appropriate and you can write back and you know reply to attacks that let's take this to a more secure platform or you know a better platform and this idea that

spk_1: personal

spk_0: cell phone numbers are out there

spk_1: how do

spk_0: you train people on how to handle that

spk_7: right i mean i think you know the problem

spk_2: is if if agencies

spk_4: don't have the capability

spk_2: to send tax and a consumer and a client sends a text to an account manager

spk_4: account manager's probably replied

spk_2: back you

spk_5: know because they're afraid that they're worried the word about

spk_2: taking the client off they're worried about not being

spk_5: reactive

spk_2: enough and they want to communicate

spk_5: on that level inversely

spk_2: if you have a platform in place then you could go ahead and reply back to the incoming text from that say hey this is mary at the agency here's our text number and you could go back and forth that way that's kind of how i would

spk_1: probably

spk_2: attempt to do that and like you said if you added the v card with that so everybody would be able to get that i think that's an

spk_5: easy way to

spk_2: start training those clients

spk_5: while

spk_2: still having that friction was communication

spk_0: yeah

spk_7: and and that really is

spk_0: sort of my last point here is that you need to train your clients if you're going to use an agency wide texting solution versus a personal individual cell phone

spk_1: it's going

spk_0: to take some kind of transition

spk_1: to

spk_0: get your clients using that agency number and i think that's actually to be difficult certainly for producers they want their cellphone out there right Well how many people don't realize that a cell phone can't do it I mean

spk_7: if we have a

spk_0: cellphone number than it's a natural thing i could just

spk_1: text him or

spk_0: her and so again training clients that you know if you have a question of problem texas absolutely an option

spk_1: and

spk_0: our agency has put into place a solution here's the number you should text too so we can make sure to get your comment question problem addressed as rapidly as possible if you continue to text too in the individual they may or may not be able to respond as quickly as we can now that we have this process and procedure in place what

spk_2: i think it talks to who owns a relationship

spk_5: as well

spk_2: you know i think

spk_1: that if

spk_2: you have a producer that has

spk_1: you know fifty

spk_2: or sixty clients and they're used to taxing him and something goes south with the producer maybe you put yourself in

spk_4: his advantage if you

spk_2: don't if you don't have the ability

spk_5: to communicate with that

spk_2: client the same mechanism you know and so i think as agency principles and people in agency space think through that you always want to kind of ensure that you have the spokes to the communication and the spokes the client i think that goes hand in hand

spk_1: so

spk_2: it's not just a compliance issue it's not just a safety issue it's also a business issue you know we've all met

spk_1: people

spk_2: change jobs you know And so we want to try to retain those relationships in the agency space and if we can centralize that number that makes that easier

spk_1: for us yeah

spk_0: no question and and i think there's a lots of opportunity for

spk_1: text

spk_0: notifications

spk_1: that

spk_0: an agency khun do so it could be in a storm's coming to the area here's a couple of ah you know tips or how to speak safe

spk_3: or hears as a

spk_0: reminder here's our you know claim number or if you have a problem or issue let us know somebody will be available twenty four hours all of those kinds of things again are part of developing that customer experience

spk_1: so

spk_0: those air absolutely things with that agency should be thinking about and implementing you know what can we do there

spk_1: in

spk_0: that same breath there some very

spk_1: stringent

spk_0: right now fcc federal communication commission compliance issues with that broadcast

spk_1: text so

spk_0: not the one on one right you to me

spk_1: but i'm

spk_0: sending text out

spk_1: too three

spk_0: hundred people one hundred whatever that that number is

spk_1: and the

spk_0: fcc compliance basically says you need teo get that individuals each individual

spk_1: written

spk_0: consent and actually the wording is written consent now could that be elektronik signature could be right

spk_7: i think absolutely

spk_0: my point is

spk_1: you can't

spk_0: just assume that somebody's going to want because they've texted in

spk_1: they're

spk_0: going to want to receive a broadcast text back out so

spk_1: really

spk_0: two things one is customer experience

spk_1: ask would

spk_0: you like to receive and here's you know five examples for examples whatever it is of types of notifications we are able and willing to send out to you and if so then you know just sign this document indicating that you would like to do that

spk_1: you know for

spk_4: our agency we have

spk_2: two different text alerts one is business

spk_4: is closed

spk_2: we have inclement weather the other is employee benefits information

spk_5: and so we did allow both of our

spk_2: staff topped in you know hey this is an optional deal right if you don't want this let us know

spk_5: will take your number

spk_2: out the vast majority people did not want

spk_5: employee benefits information

spk_1: you know they

spk_2: definitely want to know if the office was closed

spk_6: on yours hey really wanted

spk_2: to know when they got to stay home and so we're doing that

spk_5: you know you don't want

spk_2: to get spank me and i think that you

spk_4: start messing with the cell

spk_2: phone and that's a quick call to somebody

spk_5: because you're here tam

spk_1: yeah

spk_7: and i actually had a friend

spk_0: of mine we were at a conference

spk_1: recently

spk_0: and the

spk_7: hotel asked

spk_0: for the room wasn't ready so the hotel asked for

spk_1: who was the

spk_0: number and said you know we'll text you when the room your room is ready which was fine permission would you like to you know give us that yes i would and

spk_1: text

spk_0: when the room was right he was received

spk_1: um later

spk_0: that evening or first thing than the next morning another text was received saying how is your statement

spk_1: Very

spk_0: innocent question

spk_1: and

spk_0: and they probably thought a follow up

spk_1: this person

spk_0: was really upset because they hadn't given permission

spk_0:

spk_0: for that

spk_7: right They had given

spk_0: very limited permission for yes let me know when my room is ready so my stance is you've got to be extremely careful through and respectful of someone's

spk_1: text or

spk_0: cell phone number and make sure that what you are sending out to them is useful helpful and they actually

spk_2: want they want it they want

spk_0: to receive it i

spk_4: would say you know for for agencies i'd be curious

spk_2: to know you know

spk_4: i think it's very easy for you to understand how prevalent

spk_2: the problem is it's a mass email that you put together and say

spk_4: who's texting in this organization clients and who to clients

spk_2: tax and then kind of getting a list back We'll

spk_4: let you understand

spk_2: how big your current problem is if

spk_4: you don't address that problem

spk_2: today if you don't have one you will have it in the future is you

spk_1: know that's

spk_2: how people wanna wantto communicate today but that's a first step for you that's a place that you can understand today do i have something that i should be really concerned about Well my compliance persons had explode if they find out how much business we're doing and so that you could do right now just shoot a mass e mail out to your organization is a let me know if you're texting customers or clients or their texting you that'll give you an indication of kind of the steps you need to take the starch remedy and how quickly

spk_1: right and

spk_0: again really start thinking about getting consent

spk_1: right

spk_0: from and

spk_2: i think you had a great point that different types right Right It's not just hey you know if you do weather alerts and then if

spk_4: you do promotional material that may be two very different use cases i may want to know if what tornadoes in my area

spk_2: and what carrier to call and what stuff to do

spk_4: i may not want to know that

spk_2: you're having a barbecue on friday that you want us to come down to write the exact and so i really like how you delineate that where it's saying just because you've agreed for one utilization doesn't mean t do it all the time

spk_1: yeah yeah and

spk_0: there's no question about that

spk_1: ah and again

spk_0: a couple of resource is here the federal communication commission the the

spk_7: act that their

spk_0: compliance standards relate to it is called the telephone consumer protection act or t c p a

spk_1: and

spk_0: in that they talk about automated telephone dialing systems right So do not call list so that's where people's mindset is fcc however has included text in this compliance arena

spk_1: ah and there's

spk_0: some litigation actually just a appellate level court came out because fcc said your individual cell phone is an automated telephone dialing system because you can text multiple people you have the capability not that you have not that you will but you could write

spk_2: i could go to the web get

spk_6: five hundred phone numbers

spk_2: put it in my cell phone and then text out hey buy something five

spk_7: something right Yep And

spk_2: now i've become a bad guy You have done something

spk_0: well and again finds from the fcc for doing that similar to the do not call this finds the appellate level court

spk_3: again decision literally

spk_0: just came out a week or so ago Said the fcc was too broad and defining what device fits the automated dialing system but they did uphold that consent idea that's in there So my point here is just be really careful and understand some of the nuances Now i want to give you a resource from the national big guy So independent insurance agents and brokers of america for those agents and brokers that are members of that you can access a memorandum that has come from their legal department specifically talking about text messaging and what agencies need two d'oh And as i

spk_7: would expect

spk_0: they came down very conservatively in terms of compliance And and actually the there is a sample of a consent form that you can use it's quite legal

spk_1: if

spk_7: i can say it that way On

spk_0: my hesitation on lee is we also have to deal with the customer experience So it's not something you we should tell our customers we can't do but we should figure out where that balance of you know potential risk and liability and helping our customers have the best experience with us They possibly can remaining

spk_2: competitive advice Yeah

spk_0: absolutely No question

spk_1: what have we missed I think

spk_4: for the first one way

spk_5: hit it pretty good i mean i think
